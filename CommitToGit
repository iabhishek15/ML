//with the above two line we have now saved the project from our working directory 
to git repostiory into our computer now we want to save it on github online

//we need to create an SSH key on our computer and then add it to our github account so that 
our termial can connect securely

//deactivate is used to deactivate the virtual server this is done using virtualenv 
//I don't use virtual env



//we will place this SSH key into new directory so we will use ~/ this is used for the 
default directory /c/Users/158si/.ssh
~/.ssh //now this .ssh will make this hidden
{in my case this already exits but how??}

//in the bash we can create key using ssh-keygen.exe

mkdir ~/.ssh
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen.exe

//It ask where you wanna save it you can press enter and save there only

dir
//.pub we want

cat id_rsa.pub

//add on github is ssh key in settings

git remote add origin https://github.com/iabhishek15/myProject.git
git push -u origin master

//when we want to do it again we just add these three lines
git add .    //{add everything from the current directory into git repository}
git commit -am 'Initial commit'
git push
